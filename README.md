# Contentstack - Quality of Life Improvements
We have all been there, we need to publish some stuff en-US or something similiar. But where is it in the list of languages? scroll scroll scroll. No more! 

This script:

* Sorts them for you and does it both in the bulk publish and the single entry publish.
* Adds a button to select everything english
* Uses your screen space to provide a long list and 4 columns to choose between.
